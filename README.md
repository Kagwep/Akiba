## Introduction

### What is the Akiba Savings ?

The Akiba Savings reimagines conventional saving methods by integrating them into a Near Protocol-based blockchain system. It empowers users to convert their savings into digital tokens, representing their commitment towards achieving their financial goals. These tokens can be redeemed upon successfully completing their savings plan.

## Key Features

* **NFT-Powered Savings:** Users deposit funds into the platform, receiving NFT tokens that symbolize their dedication to their savings objective. These NFTs are distinct and non-transferable, preventing them from being traded on external markets.

* **Scheduled Savings:** Users can establish scheduled savings plans, specifying deposit amounts and frequencies. The platform incentivizes adherence to these plans by imposing penalties for early withdrawals.

* **Penalty and Reward Mechanism:** Users withdrawing before the scheduled end date face small penalties. Collected penalties from such instances are redistributed among users who fulfill their savings plans.
